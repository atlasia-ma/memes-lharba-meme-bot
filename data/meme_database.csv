Distracted boyfriend.jpg,"“Distracted boyfriend” first entered the meme game in 2017, when a Turkish Facebook group used a stock photo of a man walking with a girl while checking out another girl to make a joke about Phil Collins. The meme continues to be relevant today while being used as inspiration for pop culture references, such as this recent one involving “Queer Eye’s” Antoni Porowski, and new celebrity couple Kate Beckinsale and Pete Davidson at a New York Rangers game."
Expanding brain.jpg,"In 2017, when a number of posters on Tumblr and 4chan started bragging about their brain sizes, it quickly turned into a meme. Photos of different sized brains are paired with “smart” sounding words until they expand into a fully enlightened stage. One of the first manifestations of the “expanding brain” meme came from the who-whom-whomst progression of words that seemingly makes one sound smarter."
Young Thug at computer.jpg,"Back in 2018 a photo surfaced of the rappers Young Thug and Lil Durk staring at a computer screen while working on new music in the studio. The internet quickly began finding humorous (and fabricated) explanations for what the two were so intently concentrating on, everything from the rappers planning an elaborate heist to playing old school games like minesweeper."
First World problems.jpg,"While the “First World” terminology has been around for a while, the hashtag #firstworldproblems reached its peak in popularity on Twitter in 2011 after Buzzfeed posted a series of memes about problems experienced by privileged people from wealthy countries. The meme almost always depicts an attractive person looking sad, with a caption explaining his or her First World frustrations."
Change my mind.jpg,"After Steven Crowder, a conservative podcaster, posted a photo of himself in 2018 sitting at a desk with a sign saying “Male privilege is a myth: Change my mind,” it was almost too easy for the internet to begin making fun of him with memes of their own. Memes ranged from simply changing the words on the sign to elaborate photoshops."
Drake.jpg,"Drake has been the subject of several different memes throughout his long career. His 2015 single “Hotline Bling” was one of the biggest songs of the year, and when the music video came out featuring Drake dancing in a brightly lit cube structure the memes began to accumulate even more. Since then the internet has memed everything from his Twitter posts to school portraits."
Is this a….jpg,The “is this a pigeon” meme first rose to popularity in 2011 after Tumblr posted a photo from a Japanese animated show of an android mistaking a butterfly for a pigeon. Most of the memes derived from the photo use the subjects to express modern confusions or paranoia.
Real name Google searches.jpg,"“Real name Google searches” is a meme that gained popularity in 2018 using the generic google template to depict made-up names for popular celebrities (usually those who go by aliases). According to Know Your Meme, it first appeared showing the rapper Lil Pump’s name as “Lilliam Pumpernickel” and only got more ridiculous from there."
Futurama Fry.jpg,"“Futurama Fry” is one of the most relatable memes on the web. One popular meme, which began in 2011, shows the character Fry from the animated show “Futurama” with eyes narrowed thinking about contradicting questions usually referring to modern times or sarcasm. Another is a generic photo with the same character holding cash yelling “shut up and take my money,” used for when someone finds the description of a product on the internet particularly appealing."
Weird flex but OK.jpg,The phrase “weird flex but OK” is used when someone brags about something that others would find awkward or just plain irrelevant.

One of the most popular uses of the meme was during the recent Brett Kavanaugh hearings after he used his high school virginity as an argument.
This is fine.jpg,"Taken out of a 2013 webcomic strip called “On Fire,” this image showing a human-like dog enjoying his coffee while his house is burning down has seemingly become more and more relatable every year. The image is rarely altered, simply attached to troubling or hard-to-grasp news."
FBI agent.jpg,"Jokes about “big brother watching” are old, but in early 2018 the internet was more paranoid than ever before thanks to the internet-fueled idea of FBI agents watching people through their webcams. The memes aren’t always critical, either; most of them depict the agents either protecting or being friendly with their subjects."
Kermit.jpg,"The iconic green puppet has stolen the hearts of millions on the “Muppet Show” since the 1950s, but the internet meme sensation didn’t begin until 2014. Most notable memes include Kermit sipping on some tea with passive aggressive text followed by “but that’s none of my business,” as well as another with a hooded Kermit formatted to show good vs. evil thoughts."
Cats.jpg,"From “I need dis” to “Nyan Cat,” there really isn’t one subject that emcompasses the internet’s love of memes better than cats. Since the early 2000s when “Keyboard Cat” first made an appearance on YouTube, people have been posting funny images of felines paired with hilarious text."

A Star is Born.jpg,"When the first trailer for the highly anticipated movie starring Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga came out in 2018, excited fans took screenshots and made them into memes.

Angry Patrick.jpg,"Also known as “evil Patrick” or “savage Patrick,” this meme takes a still of the character Patrick from “Spongebob Squarepants” with a menacing look in his eyes from a 1999 episode.

By age 35….jpg,"Following a 2018 MarketWatch article that implied an unrealistic amount of savings one should have in their 30s, people on Twitter began responding to the article by sharing all the other things you should ideally have by age 35 (from the hilariously true to the ridiculous). Advice on avocado toast, Pokemon, and drawers full of miscellaneous chargers followed."
Don’t say it.jpg,"The “don’t say it” meme details the relatable conversations people have between themselves and their brains, from bringing up awkward conversations topics to resisting “that’s what she said” jokes. The first tweet with the meme showed up in 2010, but later resurfaced in 2017 and showed an inner struggle between whether or not to start a conversation with a taxi driver."
Handshakes.jpg,"The 1987 film “Predator” starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers contained within it what could be the manliest handshake of all time, and in 2007 it began gaining traction on YouTube.

Roll Safe.jpg,"In 2016 a British mockumentary starring actor Kayode Ewumi called “Hood Documentary” was uploaded onto YouTube by BBC. Soon after, people on the internet began using a screen-grabbed image of Ewumi pointing to his temple like he had a good idea to reversely joke about bad decisions and poor thinking."
"Thank u, next.jpg","When Ariana Grande released her single “Thank U, Next” about her ex-boyfriends in early 2019, fans quickly began creating memes out of the lyrics.

Let’s get this bread.jpg,People on the internet use the “Let’s get this bread” meme ironically (usually it is slang for earning money) to make fun of people or themselves for trying too hard to earn money.

World’s most interesting man.jpg,"Most people will recognize the “world’s most interesting man” (played by actor Jonathan Goldsmith) from the Dos Equis beer commercials that began in 2008.

Hard to swallow pills.jpg,The “hard to swallow pills” meme uses two stock photos from WikiHow that were first posted to the internet in August 2017.

Who would win.jpg,"The internet has taken the childhood game of “who would win” to a whole new level with this meme.

“Today” days old.jpg,“Today days old” is used as a response to any random realization. It first came from posts asking “How old were you when you realized X?” with someone responding: “I was today years old.” This can be a fact both well-known or more obscure.
Pepe.jpg,"Pepe the frog is a fictional character that first appeared in a 2005 comic, and has gone through multiple transformations since then. Starting out as a positive meme known as “feel good frog” in 2008, Pepe was edited into a more sad or angry meme a few years later.

Krusty Krab vs. Chum Bucket.jpg,"Just about every “Spongebob Squarepants” fan knows about the intense rivalry between the Krusty Krab and the Chum Bucket restaurants, but the former usually reigns supreme.
